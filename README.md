# Svelte Material Dashboard

## About
A group I worked with used Microsoft Access Database forms and controls for data entry and tracking of reporting projects. This repo is a development project to demo modernizing the user experience (UX) and to learn web development (including backend, frontend, and charting). Because web development is new to me, I collaborated heavily with [masyukun](https://github.com/masyukun) for writing REST services in node.js and svelte component development.

The project is a single page application (SPA) using:
1. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a web framework by Rich Harris
2. [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/web), design language software by Google
3. [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/), a charting library by Torstein HÃ¸nsi

The mock data is JSON format and the backend is node.js.

The custom Material Design svelte components are prototypes for a more standard and robust stack we will be working on called svelterial.
